 FELM is a meta benchmark to *evaluate factuality evaluation* for large language models.
 The benchmark comprises 847 questions that span five distinct domains: world knowledge, science/technology, writing/recommendation, reasoning, and math. We gather prompts corresponding to each domain by various sources including standard datasets like truthfulQA, online platforms like Github repositories, ChatGPT generation or drafted by authors.

 We then obtain responses from ChatGPT for these prompts. For each response, we employ fine-grained annotation at the segment level, which includes reference links, identified error types, and the reasons behind these errors as provided by our annotators.

#### Typical Data Point


```
{"index": "0", 
 "source": "quora", 
 "prompt": "Which country or city has the maximum number of nuclear power plants?", 
 "response": "The United States has the highest number of nuclear power plants in the world, with 94 operating reactors. Other countries with a significant number of nuclear power plants include France, China, Russia, and South Korea.",
 "segmented_response": ["The United States has the highest number of nuclear power plants in the world, with 94 operating reactors.", "Other countries with a significant number of nuclear power plants include France, China, Russia, and South Korea."], 
 "labels": [false, true],
 "comment": ["As of December 2022, there were 92 operable nuclear power reactors in the United States.", ""], 
 "type": ["knowledge_error", null], 
 "ref": ["https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=207&t=3"]}
